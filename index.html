    <h3>WHAT IS SOCIAL MEDIA(h3)</h3>
    <p>
      Social media is an internet-based form of communication. Social media
      platforms allow users to have conversations, share information and create
      web content. There are many forms of social media, including blogs,
      micro-blogs, wikis, social networking sites, photo-sharing sites, instant
      messaging, video-sharing sites, podcasts, widgets, virtual worlds, and
      more. The following are types of social media sites

    <h4>TWITTER(h4)</h4>
    
    <h5>WHAT IS TWITTER(h5)</h5>
    
    <p> Twitter is a social media site, and its primary purpose is to connect people and allow people to share their thoughts with a big audience. Twitter allows users to discover stories regarding today's biggest news and events, follow people or companies that post content they enjoy consuming, or simply communicate with friends. Additionally, PR teams and marketers can use Twitter to increase brand awareness and delight their audience.</p>
 
    <h5>Origin of Twitter</h5>
 <p>In 2006, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, had an idea -- he would create a SMS-based communications platform in which friends could keep tabs on each other by updating statuses. In the beginning, Twitter was an idea all-too-similar to texting.

    The idea evolved, in large part due to brainstorming sessions with Dorsey's co-founder, Evan Williams.
    
    On March 21, 2006, Jack sent the first tweet, which read -- "just setting up my twttr."
    
    Twitter saw explosive growth at the 2007 South By Southwest Interactive conference, during which more than 60,000 tweets were sent. The Twitter team took advantage of the conference to begin growing their user base.
    
    Twitter began as an SMS-based platform, so the 140 character limit was initially simply a necessity -- mobile carriers imposed the limit, not Twitter.
    
    However, as Twitter grew to become a web platform, they kept the limit simply because it aligned with Twitter's brand -- Twitter is a platform that aims to create highly skimmable content for our tech-heavy, attention-deficit modern world.
    
    Twitter has grown exponentially over the past 10+ years. Its purpose is ultimately to spread information fast -- while that information is not always serious (Kim Kardashian's thoughts on makeup, for instance), it sometimes is (like when Iranian protesters used Twitter to assemble marches).

 <h4> WHATSAPP</h4>
 
 <h5>WHAT IS WHATSAPP</h5>
 
 <p>WhatsApp is a free, multiplatform messaging app that lets you make video and voice calls, send text messages, and more — all with just a Wi-Fi connection. WhatsApp might be a little-known messaging app in the US, but in many parts of the globe, it's an essential part of everyday life. The Facebook-owned app is easily one of the most popular messaging services in the world.

    To understand WhatsApp's popularity, you need to understand it was one of the first mobile apps to offer free, internet-based messaging. Instead of sending texts using cellular-data networks, where fees may apply, WhatsApp primarily relies on a Wi-Fi connection to send and receive messages and calls for free. 
    
    Fast forward to now: WhatsApp is preferred by over 2 billion users for its ability to streamline communications, no matter their device or location.
    
    Not only is WhatsApp simple to use, it also offers far more features and customizations than traditional SMS messaging — all for free. If you're already familiar with the app, you may be interested in our favorite WhatsApp tips and tricks.

        <h4> INSTAGRAM</h4>
        <h5>WHAT IS INSTAGRAM</h5>
        <p>Instagram is a free photo and video sharing app available on iPhone and Android. People can upload photos or videos to our service and share them with their followers or with a selected group of friends. They can also view, comment and like posts shared by their friends on Instagram. Anyone aged 13 and over can create an account by registering an email address and selecting a username.nstagram allows users to edit and upload photos and short videos through a mobile app. Users can add a caption to each of their posts and use hashtags and location-based geotags to index these posts and make them searchable by other users within the app. Each post by a user appears on their followers' Instagram feeds and can also be viewed by the public when tagged using hashtags or geotags. Users also have the option of making their profile private so that only their followers can view their posts.

            As with other social networking platforms, Instagram users can like, comment on and bookmark others' posts, as well as send private messages to their friends via the Instagram Direct feature. Photos can be shared on one or several other social media sites -- including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr -- with a single click.
            
            Instagram is not only a tool for individuals, but also for businesses. The photo-sharing app offers companies the opportunity to start a free business account to promote their brand and products. Companies with business accounts have access to free engagement and impression metrics. According to Instagram's website, more than 1 million advertisers worldwide use Instagram to share their stories and drive business results. Additionally, 60% of people say they discover new products through the app.
            
            History of Instagram
            Instagram was started in San Francisco by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who initially tried creating a platform similar to Foursquare but then turned their attention exclusively to photo sharing. The word Instagram is an amalgam of "instant camera" and "telegram."
            
            The iOS app was released through the iTunes App Store on Oct. 6, 2010, and the Android app was released on April 3, 2012. The platform's popularity skyrocketed, with the company reporting more than 40 million active users just two years after launch. This caught the attention of Facebook, which officially purchased Instagram for $1 billion in the summer of 2012.
